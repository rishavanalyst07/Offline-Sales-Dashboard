# Offline-Sales-Dashboard

Description - Developed an offline Power BI Sales Dashboard for Leeford Healthcare that unified Primary & Secondary Sales KPIs, improving sales visibility, forecasting accuracy, distributor performance tracking, and inventory planning.

1. Improved sales visibility with Primary Sales Target vs Achieved and % Achievement KPIs, helping managers track progress and address gaps faster.
2. Strengthened distributor performance management by using Secondary Sales Target vs Achieved KPIs to understand retail demand and improve sales execution.
3. Helped refine channel strategies through a clear breakdown of GT vs MT Sales Contribution, improving resource allocation across trade channels.
4. Improved regional decision-making with Region-wise Target vs Achieved visuals, enabling managers to quickly identify underperforming regions.
5. Enhanced supply chain efficiency with Days of Stock (DOS) insights, helping reduce stockouts and excess inventory at distributor warehouses.
6. Made business reviews faster and more data-driven by consolidating key KPIs such as % Growth, Value Change (₹), MoM Trends, and Achievement %.
